# LoadBalancer
- An effective load balancer for 0.11.0 clients
- 
**What is a LoadBalancer?**
LoadBalancer is a term developers like to use to equally distribute users across servers.

**Do I need this?**
If you have more then one server I suggest you use this to direct players so there would always be a server to join

**When will this be ready?**
My goal is to finish this by the tine 0.11.0 comes out

**I'm confused! Please teach me how to use this plugin!**
I'm working on a tutorial :)
